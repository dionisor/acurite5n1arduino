# acurite5n1arduino
Arduino sketch for receiving and decoding messages from Acurite 5n1 Weather Stations using 433 MHz RX module 

Thanks to @helgew for tips on windspeed formula.

 * works with 433 MHz superhet RX module. Tested with RFM83C from anarduino. (Tried also with cheaper regen module from ebay - too noisy, didn't work.)
