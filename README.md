# acurite5n1arduino
Arduino sketch for receiving and decoding messages from Acurite 5n1 Weather Station (VN1TXC) using 433 MHz RX module 

Thanks to @helgew for tips on windspeed formula.

 * works with 433 MHz superhet RX module, i.e., one with a crystal. Tested with RFM83C from anarduino. (Tried also with cheaper regen module, i.e., one *without* a crystal, from ebay but too noisy, didn't work. YMMV)
